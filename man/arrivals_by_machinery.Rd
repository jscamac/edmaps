\title{Estimates pest arrivals through imported machinery}
\usage{
arrivals_by_machinery(
  pop_density,
  total_machinery,
  probability,
  outfile,
  summarise_uncertainty = FALSE,
  return_rast = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop_density}{A \code{RasterLayer} or file path to a raster file 
containing population density.}

\item{total_machinery}{Integer. Amount of machinery entering country.}

\item{probability}{Numeric vector of one or more probabilities that a
machinery item a pest.}

\item{outfile}{Character. Output raster file path. If \code{probability} has
length > 1, the file type must support multiband rasters (e.g. GeoTiff). If
not provided, raster object will be returned to R.}

\item{return_rast}{Logical. Should the raster object be returned to R?
Ignored if \code{outfile} is not provided.}
}
\value{
If \code{outfile} is specified, the resulting raster (multiband if
  \code{probability} has length > 1) is saved as a tiff at that path. If
  \code{return_rast} is \code{TRUE} or \code{outfile} is not specified the
  resulting raster object is returned, otherwise \code{NULL} is returned 
  invisibly.
}
\description{
Estimates pest arrivals through imported machinery as a function of
population density.
}
\details{
This pathway is used under the assumption that the vast majority of
  imported machinery comprises new and used motor vehicles.
