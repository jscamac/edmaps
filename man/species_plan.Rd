\arguments{
\item{species}{The name of the species. This will be used for naming output
files and folders.}

\item{clum_classes}{An integer vector indicating which ACLUM classes are
considered host plants for \code{species}. Either \code{clum_classes} or
\code{nvis_classes} (or both) must be provided. If \code{user_host_path} is
also provided, the union of the two datasets will be used to define host
distribution.}

\item{nvis_classes}{An integer vector indicating which NVIS classes are
considered host plants for \code{species}. Either \code{clum_classes} or
\code{nvis_classes} (or both) must be provided.}

\item{host_path}{Character. Optional file path to a raster dataset that
describes the distribution of host material for the species. The file must
be readable by GDAL. All cell values other than zero or NA will be
considered to be host material. Dataset will be projected and resampled as
necessary to match the spatial extent and resolution of analysis. If
\code{clum_classes} is also provided, the union of the two datasets will be
used to define host distribution. A valid coordinate reference system must
be associated with the spatial dataset.}

\item{pathways}{A character vector of invasion pathways that should be
included. Can be one or more of: \code{'containers'}, \code{'fertiliser'},
\code{'food'}, \code{'goods'}, \code{'machinery'}, \code{'mail'},
\code{'nurserystock'}, \code{'residents'}, \code{'torres'},
\code{'tourists'}, \code{'vessels'}.}

\item{include_abiotic_weight}{Logical. Should suitability be dependent on
climate? Considered TRUE if \code{climate_suitability_path} is provided,
or if \code{use_gbif} is TRUE.}

\item{climate_suitability_path}{Optional file path to a raster describing
climatic suitability across the landscape. If provided, the raster must be
have the Australian Albers coordinate system (EPSG:3577), spatial
resolution of 1000 m, and must have xmin = -1888000, xmax = 2122000,
ymin =-4847000, ymax = -1010000. If not provided and
\code{include_abiotic_weight} is TRUE, a range bag model will be fit to
estimate climatic suitability.}

\item{exclude_bioclim_vars}{Character vector of bioclim variables that
should not be used when fitting a range bag model (see
\code{\link{range_bag}}) of climatic suitability. Variables should be
specified as, e.g., \code{c("bio01", "bio12")}. Ignored if
\code{climate_suitability_path} is provided.}

\item{include_ndvi}{Logical. Should biotic suitability be dependent on NDVI?}

\item{aggregated_res}{A numeric vector of 2 elements, indicating the desired
resolution of aggregated establishment likelihood rasters, in metres.}

generated?}

\item{clum_path}{Path to the ACLUM raster.}

\item{nvis_path}{Path to the NVIS raster.}

\item{ndvi_path}{Path to the NDVI raster.}

\item{airport_beta}{Numeric. Parameter controlling the distribution of
international tourists passengers around international airport. Default is
\code{log(0.5)/200} (i.e. 50\% of passengers within 200km of airport).}

\item{airport_tsi_beta}{Numeric. Parameter controlling the distribution of
Torres Strait passengers around Cairns airport. Default is
\code{log(0.5)/10} (i.e., 50\% of passengers within 10km of Cairns
airport).}

\item{port_data_path}{File path to the marine ports .csv file.}

\item{port_weight_beta}{Numeric. Defines the decay rate of an exponential
model. In the context of pests entering via the vessel pathway, this
reflects the decrease in the relative likelihood of pest arrival at
locations distant from marine ports. For example,
\code{prob_weight_beta=log(0.5)/10} would lead to distance-decay that
leads to 50\% (i.e. \code{0.5}) of establishment likelihood (prior to
considering other relevant pathways) within a distance of \code{10} map
units (i.e., 10 kilometres when \code{res} is 1000).}

\item{fertiliser_data_path}{File path to a csv file containing information
about fertiliser usage by NRM.}

\item{nrm_path}{File path to a polygon shapefile of NRMs (natural resource
management areas).}

\item{containers_data_path}{File path to the dataset giving the distribution
of containers by postcode.}

\item{postcode_path}{File path to postal areas shapefile.}

\item{occurrence_path}{Path to a .csv file containing occurrence data. Must
include columns \code{Longitude}, \code{Latitude}, and \code{Species}.
Coordinates are expected to be in decimal degrees (WGS84).}

\item{infected_countries}{A character vector of countries within which the
\code{species} occurs. Ignored if \code{climate_suitability_path} is
provided.Only one of \code{infected_countries} or \code{cabi_path} should
be provided.}

\item{cabi_path}{Path to a .csv file downloaded from CABI, indicating the
countries within which the \code{species} occurs. Download links to these
files can be found at the bottom of CABI species datasheet webpages, e.g.
https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/17685. Ignored if
\code{climate_suitability_path} is provided. Only one of
\code{infected_countries} or \code{cabi_path} should be provided.}

\item{use_gbif}{Logical. Should species occurrence records be sourced from
GBIF? Ignored if \code{climate_suitability_path} is provided.}

\item{gbif_species}{Character vector. Taxon names to use when querying GBIF.
Ignored if \code{climate_suitability_path} is provided.}

\item{gbif_min_year}{Integer. The minimum year (\code{yyyy}) to be included
when downloading GBIF data. Ignored if \code{climate_suitability_path} is
provided.}

\item{gbif_max_uncertainty}{Numeric. The maximum permissable coordinate
uncertainty for GBIF records. Ignored if \code{climate_suitability_path} is
provided.}

\item{gbif_username}{GBIF username to use for querying GBIF's occurrence
download API endpoint. If missing, the less efficient "search" endpoint
is used. Register at http://gbif.org.}

download API endpoint. If missing, the less efficient "search" endpoint
is used. Register at http://gbif.org.}

(default), or \code{'boundaries'} (polygons delineating borders of
states/territories).}

\item{minimum_probability_for_maps}{Numeric. A value between 0 and 1,
defining the minimum establishment probability to be displayed on plotted
maps. Values below this threshold will be excluded. Default is \code{1E-5}.}

\item{manual_check_flagged_records}{Logical. Should an interactive map be
used for manually checking flagged occurrence records? If \code{TRUE}, the
user will have the opportunity to select dubious points (i.e. occurrences
in countries for which CABI has no record of the species' establishment),
to be retained. If \code{FALSE} (the default), all such dubious points will
be excluded. Ignored if \code{climate_suitability_path} is provided. Note
that manual checking is not possible when using \code{\link{excel_to_plan}}
since the required interactivity will interrupt plan processing.}

\item{leakage_tourists}{Numeric. The per capita rate of pest entry that
applies to tourists.}

\item{establishment_tourists}{Numeric.}

\item{leakage_returning}{Numeric. The per capita rate of pest entry that

\description{
Generate a drake plan that facilitates reproducible generation of species
outputs.
}
\details{
To simplify reproducibility, \code{edmaps} provides an
  \emph{Excel} interface for specifying species parameters relevant to
  estimating establishment likelihood. An example spreadsheet is
  bundled with the package, available at the path given by
  \code{system.file('extdata/parameters.xlsx', package='edmaps')}. The
  spreadsheet has two sheets, the first specifying "global" parameters
  that will apply to all species (e.g. file paths to rasters that will),
  be used regardless of species identity and the second specifying
  parameters that can vary by species. In the second sheet, each row
  corresponds to a separate species. Tooltips and data validation
  guide the user with respect to expected/allowable data.
