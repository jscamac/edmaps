Description: This package combines spatial environmental data (e.g. distance 
    from airports/marine ports, distribution of pest habitat/hosts) with 
    biosecurity leakage rates (e.g. expert-elicited) to generate maps of the 
    likelihood of pest establishment across the landscape. Final outputs include 
    raster datasets (GTiff) indicating establishment likelihood across the area 
    of interest, as well as interactive (html) and static (pdf) versions of 
    these maps.
